# 🦄 Project Name: **Unicorn Overflow** 🦄

## 🧐 What Is This?

Welcome to **Unicorn Overflow** — the magical project where everything just *works*... until it doesn’t. 

Are you tired of projects that run perfectly the first time? Well, you're in luck! This one probably won’t either, but hey, at least the unicorns are cute. 🦄✨

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository (because what else are you gonna do?):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/unicorn-overflow.git
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd unicorn-overflow
    ```

3. Install dependencies (aka the magical spell ingredients):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the project (and cross your fingers):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## 🐛 Bugs? Or Features?

You may encounter a few bugs. But we prefer to call them **features** — because why not embrace the chaos? 🌪️

If your screen starts flashing colors, that’s just the unicorns communicating with you from another dimension. No need to worry... unless they ask for your credit card details.

## 🤖 Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` (or somewhere else, depending on how the universe feels today).
2. Admire the sheer beauty of whatever you just created. It may not be what you expected, but it’s certainly... something.
3. Stare blankly into the void, contemplating the meaning of life, coding, and why you got into this project in the first place.

## ✨ Features
